    <h1> Waste the Day </h1>
    <P>
At night when I lie awake <br>
I dream of all that I could have done today. <br>
I could have sat and decided to bake a cake <br>
Did I waste my day? <br>
Did I do everything I had hoped of doing? <br>
Did I push my tasks away? <br>
Did I confront the feelings inside that were brewing? <br>
Did I waste my day? <br>
No, I did not waste my day! <br>
Everyday is a time for celebration, <br>
Do not worry about what others say. <br>
I'll treat my days as a vacation. <br>
So I never waste the day. <br>
</P>
